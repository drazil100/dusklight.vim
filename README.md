# dusklight.vim

## Getting Started

To use this you need to have "set termguicolors" in your config. The theme will not look the same without this.

## About

This truecolor Vim colorscheme combines a beautiful Midnight Blue background with vibrant fluorescent text colors. This was designed from the ground up with readability in mind. The colors were painstakingly balanced by hand so that all colors are visually distinct from one another and so that no color grabs your attention more than any other color.

This colorscheme is designed to be used with `set termguicolors` enabled, however it does support 256color as well for those who don't use a truecolor terminal. You will lose the blue background using the cterm colors, but I couldn't find a blue dark enough to have the same level of readability.

For Neovim users, this colorscheme is configured to work with both Neovim's built in LSP and Treesitter highlighting.

## Leaving Feedback

I am not a master programmer with knowledge of how to program in 500 different languages nor am I an expert on every niche feature Vim / Neovim has to offer. I would really appreciate any feedback anyone has on this colorscheme no matter how small. I wan't to make this as compatible as I can with as many language, Vim features, and plugins as possible but there are simply too many highlight groups to cover everything.

If you encounter any weird compatibility issues with any language or feature of Vim, Neovim, or any plugins let me know by leaving an issue on this repo and I will see what I can do to address it.
